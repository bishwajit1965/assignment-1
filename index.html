          <p class="description">
            When I look back with dismay in the previous year and experience my
            failures, I feel restless thinking that I could have mitigated the
            shortcoming becoming a bit non-compromising with my missions and
            visions of life ahead. But time and tide waits for none. We make
            mistakes and learn through mistakes. Mistakes make us successful
            letting us know our weaknesses to be turned into our strength in the
            days to come. I have listed some to-dos of my mistakes I will
            rectify in this new year with new inspiration.So, I have
            short-listed some of my shortcomings and mistakes of last year.
